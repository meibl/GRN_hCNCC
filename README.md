# GRN_hCNCC
Gene regulatory networks were inferred from time-course paired CAGE + ATAC-seq data in human cranial neural crest cell differentiation from hiPSCs. Code underlying the presented analysis and additional useful material is provided.

Gene regulatory networks obtained by applying PECA2 (Duren et al., 2019) to our time-course paired CAGE + ATAC-seq data (d5, d8, d11 and p2 of the hCNCC differentiation from hiPSCs) can be downloaded from https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.30920222
